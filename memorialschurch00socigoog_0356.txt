REPORT FOR THE Y-EAR MCMVII.

Smcn the issue of the last Report two volumes have been
issued, and the one for the present year is passing through
the preSS. Of these two volumes the earlier is a continuation
of Wills and InventorieS, the second part of which appeared
iu 1860, under the editorship of the Rev. William Greenwell.
Μι·. J. Crawford Hodgson, the editor of the third part, has
followed Mr. Greenwell's example in giving a considerable
number of InventorieS, from which so much information can
be gathered as to the civilization and wealth in the two
Northern Counties at the close of the Seventeenth Century.
Examples of the wills and inventories of persons of the lower
middle claSS, such as yeomen aud shopkeeperS„ very -much
enhance the value of the volume.

In the Records of the Northern Convocation the Dean
of Durham, Dr. Kitchin, has gathered a large mass of infor-
mation concerning a body which, till quite modern timeS,
was entirely eclipsed by its more important sister iu the
Southern Province. In his Introduction the Editor gives a
very interesting history of the fortunes of this institution
from the beginning of the Fourteenth Century till its revival
some sixty years ago.

As no fewer than four volumes are now passing through
the press it is hoped that during the coming year· the publi-
cations of the Society may be brought up to date. Of these
the Percy Chartulary contains documentS, many of early date,
