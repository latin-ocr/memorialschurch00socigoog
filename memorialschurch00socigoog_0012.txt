PREFACE. ix

In these Chapter Acts are also several important con-
stitutions for the regulation of the staff of the Minster,
for some parochial chapelrieS, and for chantries‚ pro-
testations of residence made by canone, foundations of
chantries, visitationS, etc. In 1401 a statute was enacted
for the obsequies of King Athelstan and other kingS,
archbishops of York, and canons of Ripon, the town
crier was to go round, and the sanctuary men were to
attend at the services, In 1505 the Chapter write to
King Henry VII offering participation in all their religious
officeS, and promising special prayers for his welfare
both in this life and in the life to come. In 1517 was
executed an indenture for the making of a George and
Dragon according to one at Crystall (Kirkstall) Abbey,
registered in Chapter in 1518. In the Chapter Acts are
included also copies of several wills proved before the
Chapter. These are for the most part of the usual kind,
but those of William de Dalton, Canon, 1371, and of
william Cawood, another canon, 1419-20, are very long
and most interesting. There is a short extract from
the latter will in “ Test. Ebor.‚’' Ι, 395.

The portion of a cartulary referred to above extends
from p. 36 to p. 98 in the present volume, and all the
charters entered possess considerable local interest ; the
dates ascertained range from 1114 to 1322. Local
research might do much to identify the less-known
places mentioned, and the succession of the tenureS, but
the present editor has no opportunity for an investigation
of that description, and can only put the matter into an
accessible form, ready 'for such as shall hereafter study
or write upon that portion of Yorkshire county history
which belongs to Ripon,
