¹ This equestrian statue was no doubt intended to adorn the
chapel οι· lost ol St. George in the Minster, in connexion with which a
chantry was to have been founded. But as no such chantry appears
in the chantry certificates‚ the intention 01 the founder cannot have
been carried out. Brian Batty made provision for it in his will in
1515. This will was proved in 1520 (Mem. Rip.. 1, 331, 332), and a
foundation chartei· was sealed by John Radclyff and Ralph. son of
Briau Batty, in 1521 (Mem. Rip. Ι, 181).

² Kirkstall.
³ 1 cannot find any explanation of this word.

⁴ Repeated in the MS. 'lt would seem that the carver was to
make an imitation of iron bars in wood.
